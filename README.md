Deck of Cards: a web app for people with OCD.


React-deck-of-card-games features a suite of technologies for frontend development that I do deeply cherish:

- ui ➜ [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- application architecture ➜ [redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- drag & drop ➜ [react-dnd](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/)
- immutable data ➜ [immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
- transpiling ➜ [babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- bundling ➜ [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)




## Quick Start
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:8080 (frontend)
$ open http://localhost:3000 (backend)
$ run mongodb
there may me version incompatibility issues while running npm install command
```
##Steps to use the project
```
1. login using the username "kamini" and password "123456" (any hardcoded data since there is no register form).
2. after successful login, the page will be redirected to the game page.
3. you can play the game of cards from a shuffled deck (this is really interesting as the cards are shuffled randomly).
4. you can resume the game once you logout.
5. once all the available cards are put into the right box, you can RESTART the game.
